A production-shaped Order Management Pipeline that transforms raw orders and line items into a clean, analytics-ready orders fact table in Snowflake. Using dbt, it stages and cleans sources, computes per-item discounts, and aggregates to one row per order with built-in data quality tests. Airflow (via Cosmos) orchestrates scheduled runs so the tables stay fresh for dashboards and reporting.
